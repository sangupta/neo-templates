# neo-templates

This repository contains the [neo](https://github.com/sangupta/neo) based templates for various
project scaffolding types, mainly for *Adobe Experience Manager*. This repository will finally
yield its way to a more sophisticated way of template discovery - namely a `neo-server` that will
host all the template metadata from around the world. This is just the first step in that direction.
